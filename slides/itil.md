### What is the ITIL Framework?

The Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) framework is a set of best-practice procedures and processes for IT and digital service management. It is a framework used by a huge range of organizations to ensure IT services are fully aligned to an organization’s key goals. It’s a vital tool in the modern digital workplace and provides a clear structure for achieving digital transformation. Its latest edition was launched in 2019, ensuring the framework provides solutions to the reality of today’s IT service industry.

### What is the ITIL Framework?

There are different levels of ITIL certification for IT and digital professionals to develop their understanding of the framework. This article explores the ITIL Framework, the benefits it brings to organizations, and the merits of ITIL certification.

----

### A little bit of history

ITIL was first created in the 1980s by the UK’s Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency (CCTA), a government agency providing IT support to other departments. It was originally created to standardize the processes for IT support and service management. It consisted of a group of IT service management processes outlined in a library of books. ITIL is now owned by a partnership between the UK Cabinet Office and Capita called AXELOS.

----

### A little bit of history

Over the years the ITIL Framework has been streamlined and adapted to reflect a rapidly changing digital landscape. It has evolved alongside changes in technology and IT services and is currently in its fourth iteration. ITIL 4 provides the tools needed by organizations faced by rapidly changing and varied digital technology.

----

### A little bit of history

Today, the ITIL Framework is one of the most popular IT service frameworks in the world. It’s recognized internationally for setting the standard for IT service delivery. The ITIL framework is aligned with international quality system standards such as the ISO 20000 standards. Because of its widespread adoption, ITIL definitions and concepts act as a common language between IT service providers.

----

### A little bit of history

Organizations can use the ITIL framework to assess and improve their end-to-end delivery of digital services and products. It encourages a holistic approach to improving processes across the entire organization. These procedures can support digital change, introduce new ways of working and streamline current IT service processes.

----

### An Overview of ITIL 4 Framework

ITIL 4 was launched in 2019 and is the latest version of the ITIL Framework and has built on the success of the previous version. ITIL 3 had streamlined IT service management processes and was aligned with international service management standard ISO 20000.

----

### An Overview of ITIL 4 Framework

ITIL 4 has a renewed focus on customer experience and digital transformation. It engages with the reality of modern-day IT governance such as cloud-based services or machine learning. Digital technology is rapidly changing, and ITIL 4 provides the tools and insight to react and mitigate risk. The ITIL Framework helps organizations create an environment of efficiency and quality, delivering IT services at speed. It is a vehicle for change, as organizations can also use it to understand and implement new ways of working like DevOps, Lean and Agile.

----

### An Overview of ITIL 4 Framework

ITIL 4 ensures IT services are aligned with wider business aims through the principle of a Service Value System. The system highlighted in ITIL 4 is called the Service Value Chain. It gives organizations an operating model to deliver and improve an effective IT service. The Service Value Chain is a flexible model for planning the journey between customer demand and delivery of service. This system is key to good IT governance, as it develops a resilient organization that is responsive to change.

----

### An Overview of ITIL 4 Framework

ITIL 4 consists of 34 different practices, focusing on refining technical management, service management, and general management. Organizations gain processes and functions for all areas of service delivery, including risk management, workforce development, and asset development.

----

### The four dimensions of ITIL 4

ITIL 4 introduces four dimensions to be considered when delivering a service or product. This ensures that the full organization is taken into account, avoiding inefficient processes. It encourages organizations to map the four dimensions whenever they are designing a service or product, providing a framework for strategic-level planning. The four dimensions replace the Four Ps found in the previous version, ITIL 3 (Products, People, Partners, Processes).

----

### The four dimensions of ITIL 4

* Organizations and People
  * This dimension focuses on the structure and governance of the organization and the people involved in every aspect of the service. This includes suppliers, customers, employees, and managers. Organizations should consider how teams are connected, the level of training, and the type of organizational culture.

----

### The four dimensions of ITIL 4

* Information and Technology
  * This dimension denotes the tools, technology, and information needed to support both product delivery and IT governance and management. Considerations may include the capabilities and capacity of the support service and the technology required for the service.

----

### The four dimensions of ITIL 4

* Partners and Suppliers
  * This element centers around the external suppliers and partners that help organizations deliver products and services. The comparison of in-house versus outsourced capabilities is a key part of this dimension. Organizations should consider and compare the cost of outsourcing, as well as reliability, performance, and capacity.

----

### The four dimensions of ITIL 4

* Value Streams and Processes
  * This dimension is all about how services and products are delivered. ITIL 4 introduces the concept of a Service Value Chain, the operating model to deliver services or products. The Service Value Chain will be explored in more detail later in the article but can be used for an incident response as well as product development.

----

### The five stages of ITIL

The ITIL Service Lifecycle is an integral part of the previous version of the ITIL Framework, ITIL 3. It is a framework of processes for service management and is made up of five stages. This structure helped ITIL become synonymous with best-practice service management.

----

### The five stages of ITIL

The five ITIL 3 stages are:

* Service Strategy
* Service Design
* Service Transition
* Service Operation
* Continual Service Improvement

----

### The five stages of ITIL

The stages contain processes and principles relative to the point in the Service Lifecycle, which moves in a linear way. To bring more flexibility into service management, this aspect of the framework evolved into the new Service Value Chain with the release of ITIL 4.

----

### Understanding the Service Value Chain

The main aspect of ITIL 4 is the introduction of the Service Value Chain, a model for service delivery. It focuses on the concept of a value stream and replaces the Service Lifecycle system found in ITIL 3.

----

### Understanding the Service Value Chain

A value stream is a journey between receiving a request (or demand) and delivering a product or service (or value). In this instance, the model is based on six flexible activities that can be rearranged to create value streams for specific purposes. It’s very flexible, as the value stream doesn’t need to be linear. The order of activities is able to dynamically shift to fit the requirement. An example could be creating an incident response process as part of a risk management strategy.

----

### Understanding the Service Value Chain

The Service Value Chain naturally brings different areas of the whole organization together, with IT services as the link. The concept is an integral part of ITIL 4, as each activity can draw on procedure or practice outlined elsewhere in the framework. A holistic approach to high-level IT governance is promoted, allowing for informed strategic planning.

----

### Understanding the Service Value Chain

The six activities found within the Service Value Chain are:

* Engage
  * Engage with stakeholders to understand their needs. The aim is to forge good stakeholder relationships and understand their service requirements.

----

### Understanding the Service Value Chain

* Plan
  * Understand the direction, current status, and required improvements across the organization, services, and products.
* Improve
  * Achieve continuous improvements in services. Use the Service Value Chain to improve processes across all areas of the organization.

----

### Understanding the Service Value Chain

* Design and Transition
  * Ensure that the cost and quality of services meet the expectations of stakeholders.
* Obtain or Build
  * Ensure individual components of services are reliably available.

----

### Understanding the Service Value Chain

* Deliver and Support
  * Meet agreed expectations by delivering services and support.

----

### The Benefits of ITIL 4

In modern times, organizations must face a rapidly changing digital environment. A variety of IT systems and services are interwoven throughout the company structure and operations. The ITIL 4 Framework has evolved to meet these changes and can provide best-practice procedures for all IT services. Organizations also gain a framework to guide them through digital transformation and new ways of working to improve service efficiency.

----

### The Benefits of ITIL 4

The key benefits of ITIL 4 include:

As an internationally recognized framework for IT services, the concepts presented by ITIL 4 elevates an organization to international quality standards. ITIL 4 is shaping how organizations run their business across the world. The concepts and definitions within the ITIL Framework are a common language between international partners.

----

### The Benefits of ITIL 4

ITIL 4 has a modular structure, with baseline concepts outlined in the Foundation section. This allows organizations and individuals to get a well-rounded idea of the ITIL Framework before moving onto supplementary sections. This approach helps to create an environment of continuous, staged improvements within the organization. The stage-by-stage progression is reflected in ITIL 4 certification, with different levels providing support for each step of an IT service professional’s career. ITIL certification will be explored in detail later in this article.

----

### How Long Will the ITIL Framework Take to Implement?

The full introduction of the ITIL Framework takes time, especially if it means a root and stem change to the current way of working. It can take up to a year or more for a complex project to be fully implemented. Most organizations will introduce it in stages and may take some time to bring internal IT stakeholders on board through a proper engagement campaign. There are many steps ahead of implementation, from project alignment, the assignment of roles, an internal audit, and the designing of processes.

----

### How Long Will the ITIL Framework Take to Implement?

To begin with, organizations may use it to combat limitations or issues within current support processes. After issues are improved, organizations can move on to driving improvements to wider IT infrastructure or services. The aim should be to get key stakeholders and managers ITIL certified, to be the driving force behind the implementation of the framework. Because of the nature of ITIL 4, there will be an environment of continuous improvement which becomes the new normal.
