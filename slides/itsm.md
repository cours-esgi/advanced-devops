## ITSM

----

### What is IT Service Management (ITSM)?

IT service management - often referred to as ITSM - is simply how IT teams manage the end-to-end delivery of IT services to customers. This includes all the processes and activities to design, create, deliver, and support IT services. 

----

### What is IT Service Management (ITSM)?

The core concept of ITSM is the belief that IT should be delivered as a service. A typical ITSM scenario could involve asking for new hardware like a laptop. You would submit your request through a portal, filling out a ticket with all relevant information, and kicking off a repeatable workflow. Then, the ticket would land in the IT team’s queue, where incoming requests are sorted and addressed according to importance.

----

### What is IT Service Management (ITSM)?

Due to their day-to-day interactions with IT, people often misconstrue ITSM as basic IT support. On the contrary, ITSM teams oversee all kinds of workplace technology, ranging from laptops, to servers, to business-critical software applications. 

----

### What is IT Service Management (ITSM)?

There is a common line of thinking in the IT industry that posits that a proper approach to ITSM should follow three steps in this order:
* Build and implement IT technology.
* Bring in and enforce the right process.
* People can learn the technology and abide by the process.

----

### ITSM vs ITIL vs DevOps

IT teams leverage a variety of frameworks to guide their work. The most common ones we hear about are ITSM and DevOps, though there are numerous other concepts, like COBIT, SIAM, IT4IT, lean, and the list continues...

----

### ITSM vs ITIL vs DevOps

So what abbreviations do you need to know? Here we’ll cover two of the most influential frameworks for modern IT teams-- ITSM and DevOps-- along with a common approach to ITSM. Let’s start by defining some key terms. 
ITSM

----

### ITSM vs ITIL vs DevOps

As mentioned above, IT Service Management is simply how IT teams manage the delivery of IT services to customers. A team’s approach to ITSM can be structured to align with ITIL practices and influenced by DevOps concepts. 
ITIL

----

### ITSM vs ITIL vs DevOps

ITIL is the most widely accepted approach to ITSM. ITIL focuses on practices for aligning IT services with business needs. ITIL can help organizations adapt to ongoing transformation and scale.ITIL 4, the recent update to ITIL standards, represents a paradigm shift for IT teams. It guides teams to a holistic, business and customer-value frame of reference, and encourages a more flexible approach based on how your team works. The ITIL 4 Guiding Principles promote collaboration, simplicity, and feedback. 

----

### ITSM vs ITIL vs DevOps

ITIL is sometimes misrepresented as “the rules,” rather than guidance, that is open for interpretation. Yet, just because we need to use process and document work, doesn’t mean we should generate cumbersome masses of records and bureaucratic overhead. There is no excuse for hiding behind processes or the ITIL “rules.” 
DevOps

----

### ITSM vs ITIL vs DevOps

DevOps emphasizes accelerated IT service delivery enabled by agile and lean practices. DevOps improves collaboration between development and IT operations teams, so organizations can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably. The promised benefits include increased trust, faster software releases, an ability to solve critical issues quickly, and better management of unplanned work.

----

### ITSM vs ITIL vs DevOps

Though DevOps includes continuous development, integration, and automated delivery, the concept is founded on building a culture of collaboration between teams that historically functioned in relative siloes. Much of the context and ethos behind DevOps is about moving away from old divisions and working together – collaboratively. Unfortunately, this is often seen as pertaining just to ‘Dev’ and not ‘Ops’. 

----

### ITSM vs ITIL vs DevOps

ITSM and DevOps are typically pitched against each other, as an ‘either/or’ decision – “we are an ITSM or a DevOps house.” There is confusion about what ITSM and DevOps deliver and how they could work together. Modern, high performing teams realize that they need to both be able to work smarter and quicker, but still require process and control. 

----

### ITSM vs ITIL vs DevOps

It’s time to move beyond the ITSM vs DevOps ultimatum and use elements of both - whether you explicitly follow frameworks or not. DevOps is much more than just automated development, and promotes the importance of collaboration and a blame-free culture. Moreover, ITSM and the ITIL approach shouldn't be pigeonholed as an administrative burden, but used in an agile way to fit the unique needs of different organizations. 

----

### The importance of ITSM

ITSM benefits your IT team, and service management principles can improve your entire organization. ITSM leads to efficiency and productivity gains. A structured approach to service management also brings IT into alignment with business goals, standardizing the delivery of services based on budgets, resources, and results. It reduces costs and risks, and ultimately improves the customer experience. 

----

### The importance of ITSM

We’ve found some of the most common benefits of ITSM to include:

* Aligning IT teams with business priorities tracked through success metrics
* Enabling cross-department collaboration 
* Bringing IT teams and development teams together through streamlined project management approaches

----

### The importance of ITSM

* Empowering IT teams to share knowledge and continuously improve
* Improving request coordination for more efficient service 
* Promoting customer-centricity with self-service and better processes 
* Responding more quickly to major incidents, and preventing future ones

All of which decrease costs and lead to better service.

----

### ITSM processes

What are ITSM processes? ITIL version 4 recently shifted from recommending ITSM “processes” to introduce 34 ITSM “practices.” Their reasoning for this updated terminology is so that “elements such as culture, technology, information and data management can be considered to get a holistic vision of the ways of working.” This more comprehensive approach better reflects the realities of modern organizations. 

----

### ITSM processes

Here, we won’t worry about the nuanced differences in using the practices or processes terminology. What’s important, and true regardless of what framework your team follows, is that modern IT service teams use organizational resources and follow repeatable procedures to deliver consistent, efficient service. In fact, leveraging practice or process is what distinguishes ITSM from IT. 

----

### ITSM processes

A few of the core ITSM processes include:
* Service Request Management
* Knowledge Management
* IT Asset Management
* Incident Management
* Problem Management
* Change Management

----

### Service Request Management

Service request management is a repeatable procedure for handling the wide variety of customer service requests, like requests for access to applications, software enhancements, and hardware updates.  The service request workstream often involves recurring requests, and benefits greatly from enabling customers with knowledge and automating certain tasks.

----

### Knowledge Management

Knowledge management is the process of creating, sharing, using, and managing the knowledge and information of an organization. It refers to a multidisciplinary approach to achieving organizational objectives by making the best use of knowledge.

----

### IT Asset Management

IT asset management (also known as ITAM) is the process of ensuring an organization’s assets are accounted for, deployed, maintained, upgraded, and disposed of when the time comes. Put simply, it’s making sure that the valuable items, tangible and intangible, in your organization are tracked and being used.

----

### Incident Management

Incident management is the process to respond to an unplanned event or service interruption and restore the service to its operational state. Considering all the software services organizations rely on today, there are more potential failure points than ever, so this process must be ready to quickly respond to and resolve issues.

----

### Problem Management

Problem management is the process of identifying and managing the causes of incidents on an IT service. Problem management isn’t just about finding and fixing incidents, but identifying and understanding the underlying causes of an incident as well as identifying the best method to eliminate the root causes.

----

### Change Management

Change management ensures standard procedures are used for efficient and prompt handling of all changes to IT infrastructure, whether it’s rolling out new services, managing existing ones, or resolving problems in the code. Effective change management provides context and transparency to avoid bottlenecks, while minimizing risk.

----

### ITSM software and tools

ITSM software enables IT teams to align with business needs and take a strategic approach to organizational change, transformation, and growth. There are a wide variety of ITSM software tools available in the market, from standalone applications to platform services. 

----

### ITSM software and tools

We often hear IT teams complain that the traditional ITSM tools they use are inflexible, and consequently difficult to customize and adapt to evolving requirements. There also tend to be different tools for the various ITSM processes. Modular tools create barriers, silo people, and promulgate a lack of visibility across teams. Traditional ITSM tools are often difficult to deploy and manage, and end users avoid adopting tools that aren’t intuitive, which also leads to deficient or non-existent self-service ITSM capabilities.

----

### ITSM software and tools

Choosing the right service desk software for your organization is critical, as the service desk is a foundation of ITSM. The service desk will be the interface between customers and the IT team. ITIL defines a service desk as "the single point of contact between the service provider and the users. A typical service desk manages incidents and service requests, and also handles communication with the users." The service desk should also play an important role in managing other ITSM processes.

----

### ITSM software and tools

Consider whether your service desk and other ITSM tools meet the following requirements:

* Easy to use and setup - Comes with a clean, intuitive self-service portal that makes it easy to request help, search knowledge, and track progress on issues.
* Enables collaboration - Provides a platform for developers and cross-functional teams to work together for faster issue resolution.
* Adapts to your needs - Is flexible enough to support any resolution, escalation, or change process your IT Teams might dream up.

----

### What is a service request?

IT teams receive a wide variety of customer requests. Whether incoming inquiries are asking for access to applications, software licenses, password resets, or new hardware, the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) classifies these as service requests.  Service requests are often recurring, so efficient IT teams follow a repeatable procedure to handle them. 

Service request management is related to, but distinct from other service management practices including incident, problem, and change management. Service request management uniquely involves a user submitting their request for something new --whether that’s access to a service, a new phone, or information.

ITIL specifies that along with the service desk, service requests are managed by the request fulfilment process.

----

### What is request fulfillment?

Request fulfillment is the process of resolving a customer’s service request and refers to managing the entire lifecycle of all service requests. The service desk team is dedicated to responding to and fulfilling requests while delivering the highest level of service support quality to the customer. 

Request fulfillment is about enabling employees by providing access to the IT services they need to be productive. It should help users see available services, understand how to request them, and set expectations for how long requests will take to be addressed. 

In organizations that generate large numbers of service requests, it’s smart to handle service requests as a separate work stream – and to record and manage them as a separate record type. This should be a distinct process from your other IT processes.

----

### Incident management vs service request management

A common question that comes up about service request management is how it relates to core IT practices including incident, problem, and change management. It’s worth briefly covering certain key terms before getting into distinctions.

* Service request
  * A formal user request for something new to be provided. Example: “I need a new Macbook.”
* Incident
  * An unplanned event that disrupts or reduces the quality of a service and requires an emergency response. Example: “The website is down!”
* Problem
  * The underlying cause of recurring or preventable incidents. Example: “That application issue strikes again!”
* Change
  * Adding, modifying, or removing something that could affect IT services. This can be tied to a service request. Example: “I need to upgrade the database!”

Service requests should be handled as a distinct workstream to help IT teams focus on delivering more valuable work and better enabling the rest of the organization. Service requests are quite often low risk, and can be expedited or even automated. For instance, if a new employee submits a service request for access to a software application, that request can be pre-approved and automatically granted. 

All of this means that the IT team can reduce stress, save time, and avoid overly complicated workflows. Considering the variety of incoming change, incident, and service requests you have to handle, separate workstreams and records will allow your team to figure out how best to allocate your resources.

----

### The service request management process

While there are some variations in the way a service request can be captured and fulfilled, it’s important to focus on driving standardization to improve overall service quality and efficiency. The following process represents a simple request fulfillment process based on ITIL recommendations. This can be used as a starting point for adapting existing ITIL processes or defining new ones.

----

### The service request management process

![](imgs/service-request-flow.png)

----

### The service request management process

The service request fulfillment process, in brief:
* A customer requests help from your service portal or via email.
* The IT service team assesses the request alongside pre-defined approval and qualification processes. If needed, they send the request for financial or business approval.
* A service desk agent works to fulfill the service request, or forwards the request to someone who can.
* After resolving the request, the agent closes the ticket and consults the customer to make sure they are satisfied.

----

### Service request management priorities

A strong service request management practice is customer focused, knowledge centric, and streamlined with automation. By applying these principles across your efforts, your organization can strengthen the IT support team, make it easy for customers to ask for help and get answers, and use tech to keep pace with changing organizational needs.

Here are recommendations of what IT service teams should prioritize to get closer to the customer and deliver the best service possible.

----

### Support the support team

The unsung heroes of any organization, support teams understandably get burnt out by the sheer volume of tickets they handle. Requests for services often exceed the supply of available time and resources. IT service teams in large corporations are constantly responding to requests from the business, often falling into the mode of reacting first to the customers who make the most noise. Meanwhile, customers complain that IT is difficult to work with, unresponsive, and takes too long to fulfill the requests they need to do their job. IT shouldn’t be thought of as a bottleneck. 

To deliver better customer service, it’s important to focus on the well-being and development of frontline support teams. Typical tiered support teams are highly structured and manage requests via escalations. We recommend a more collaborative approach to service request management. In this approach, every member of the support team can get closer to the customer and answer questions. When IT teams swarm issues in tools like Slack, they also gain an opportunity for everyone to learn from the process of resolving the request. 

By adding regular retros, the team gets a moment to step back and review everything that happened, on an ideally weekly basis. This provides a chance to ask questions, pinpoint areas for improvement, and make sure requests are routed to the appropriate teams. Becoming a learning focused team and embracing continuous improvement means the IT support team can be better customer advocates.  

Working in IT can be a difficult and thankless job.

----

### Shift left

To move out of a chaotic service request mess, one popular recommendation is to “shift left.” So, what does “shift left “mean? It’s moving request fulfillment as close to the front line – and customer – as possible. This improves the customer experience by speeding up time to resolution, simplifying support activity, and reducing the overall cost of request fulfillment. 

For instance, a knowledge base with searchable articles can work wonders in deflecting tickets. Or, customizing your request intake forms to gather relevant information can reduce long back-and-forth conversations. 
Diagram showing value of shifting left in IT support

Customers want a single place to go for help. Centralize the help seeker experience and make it as easy to access and use as possible.  Many organizations have created a self-service portal only for it to gather (metaphorical) dust. Learn from their mistakes, and create something based around the unique culture of your organization. Remember, that even if you build the most powerful self-service system, it’s worthless if customers can’t easily find it. 

----

### Shift left

![](imgs/support-levels.png)

----

### Leverage automation

When you incorporate automation into your self service capability you reduce the overall workload for your IT team by removing common repetitive tasks.  For example, use automation to speed up the follow-up communications your agents complete manually today, improve the way you communicate with customers, and keep stakeholders updated on estimated resolution time. Canned responses for certain requests provide useful information to the customer and reduce the workload for the agent.  Customers often don’t know where to seek help from, and automation can also be used to route service requests to the appropriate team for expedited resolution.

----

### Be ready to scale up

As your organization grows, delivering service becomes increasingly complex.  More teams are involved in managing queues of requests. With more need to delegate responsibilities, and pass work between teams, context is often lost. We hear stories from customers that acquire new business units or companies, and face a daunting process to onboard them into their systems.

A service catalog provides information about the live IT services that are available for deployment. The ability to quickly deploy a service catalog, without a developer can enable you to adapt to changing business needs.

----

### Service request management best practices

So what does it take to create an efficient service request management process? Here are 8 tips to consider:
* Begin with the most common, simple, and easily fulfilled requests. Defining them provides immediate value to customers and allows the IT team to learn as they build out future phases of the request workstream. 
* Document all your requirements for your service requests-- question fields, approval process, fulfillment procedures, fulfillment team, process owner, SLAs, reporting, etc. This will allow the IT team to best manage the request offering over time. This step is very important for more complex request offerings that will evolve over time.
* Capture the data needed to start the request process upon intake, but don’t overload the customer with too many questions.
* Standardize and automate the approval process where possible. For example, all requests for new monitors are considered pre-approved (and automatically fulfilled if possible) and all software requests need to be approved by the customer’s manager.
* Review the request fulfillment process and procedures to identify which support teams are responsible for completing the request, and if any special requirements exist. Streamline with automation if possible. 
* Identify what information should be available in the knowledge base when a request offering is released. The overall goal of self-service is to give your customers what they want faster and to deflect requests where possible, so if you can answer a question in a common FAQ, include this knowledge as a part of the plan when creating the service request offering.
* Review Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to ensure you have the proper measurements and notifications in place so that requests are fulfilled in a timely manner.
* Identify what reporting and metrics are needed to properly manage the lifecycle of a service request. Start tracking with metrics like CSAT (customer satisfaction), time to response, time to resolution, and time to close.

### What is IT asset management (ITAM)?

IT asset management (also known as ITAM) is the process of ensuring an organization’s assets are accounted for, deployed, maintained, upgraded, and disposed of when the time comes. Put simply, it’s making sure that the valuable items, tangible and intangible, in your organization are tracked and being used.  

So, what’s an IT asset? Defined simply, an IT asset includes hardware, software systems, or information an organization values.

IT assets have a finite period of use. To maximize the value an organization can generate from them, the IT asset lifecycle can be proactively managed. Each organization may define unique stages of that lifecycle, but they generally include planning, procurement, deployment, maintenance, and retirement.   An important part of IT asset management is applying process across all lifecycle stages to understand the total cost of ownership and optimize the use of assets.

In the past, IT departments were able to control assets within their own domain. Now, an organization’s asset management practice extends far beyond the hardware that’s issued with an official IT stamp of approval.  Subscription-based software and employees expectation to customize the tools they work with through marketplaces and app stores, present new asset management challenges. The way modern teams work requires that IT teams be flexible and adapt their asset management process to best enable the business. 

As various teams push to work with the tools that best fit their needs, asset management is an even more important part of an organization’s overall strategy and provides up-to-date information to reduce risks and costs. An asset management process creates a single source of truth when optimizing budgets, supporting lifecycle management, and making decisions that impact the entire organization. 

As teams outside of IT begin to embrace service management, asset management has also become important to a variety of departments. We’ve heard of organizations using asset management software to manage things ranging from fleets, to fish, to insurance, to musical instruments. 

----

### Providing a single source of truth

Too often, assets get tracked in a ton of different places, by a ton of different people.  No single person owns things, and no single tool collects and centralizes the information. Naturally, chaos and inaccuracy follow. It’s difficult to make informed decisions.  There are even companies where people are being employed just to keep track of IT assets. Systems should do this work. Without having to relegate time and brain matter to tracking artifacts, monitoring usage, and understanding dependencies, IT employees can focus more on what matters most to the organization.  Asset management brings order, and offers a single source of truth for IT teams, management, and ultimately, entire organizations.
----

### Improving utilization and eliminating waste

Asset management keeps information updated, so teams eliminate waste and improve utilization. It saves money by helping avoid unnecessary purchases and cutting licensing and support costs. Increased control also enforces compliance with security and legal policies and reduces risks. The positive implications on costs and productivity benefit the entire organization.
----

### Enabling productivity without compromising reliability

With digital transformation changing the way organizations operate, modern asset management goes far beyond tracking laptops and mice. Teams are embracing DevOps and SRE principles, and need asset management processes and tools in order to efficiently deliver new functionality and services quickly without compromising on reliability. In the report Prepare Your IT Asset Management for 2020, Gartner notes that given the increased reliance on platform and infrastructure services, effective asset management can enable organizations to manage their consumption of “on-demand services.” With increased control, visibility, and assigned responsibility, teams can reduce excess consumption including overprovisioning, and idle instances, avoiding unnecessary costs. 
----

### Supporting ITSM practices and enabling teams across organizations

IT asset management is critical to supporting ITIL processes, including change, incident, and problem management. The IT team enables the entire organization to get more innovative and deliver value more quickly. With the right data at their fingertips, teams can move with speed and predict the impact of changes before they happen. By democratizing access to insights, the organization gains a competitive edge, delivering value more quickly.  Any organization trying to keep up with the pace of modern innovation needs to get strategic about controlling, tracking, and mastering IT data.

----

### What is incident management?

Incident management is the process of responding to an unplanned event or service interruption to restore the service to its operational state. According to ITIL (IT Infrastructure library), “the incident management process ensures that normal service operation is restored as quickly as possible and the business impact is minimized.”

Incidents are events of any kind that disrupt or reduce the quality of service (or threaten to do so). A business application going down is an incident. A crawling-but-not-yet-dead web server can be an incident, too. It’s running slowly and interfering with productivity. Worse yet, it poses the even-greater risk of complete failure.

For the sake of getting everyone on the same page, here are some quick definitions of related terms:

ITSM (IT service management) is a common approach to creating, supporting, and managing IT services. The core concept of ITSM is the belief that IT should be delivered as a service. And one of the core practices of ITSM is incident management. 

ITIL is a set of best practices for ITSM (think of it as a playbook). 

A problem is the not-yet-known root cause behind one or more incidents. In the incident above where the network is creeping and a business application is down, a misconfigured router could be the underlying problem behind both. 

----

### The importance of incident management as an ITSM practice

Considering all the software services organizations rely on today, there are more potential failure points than ever. And, the impact of an incident can be huge. Research says major incidents can cost $300,000 for every hour a system is down. For some web-based services, that number can be dramatically higher.  

Having a well-defined incident management process can help reduce those costs dramatically. The benefits of a well-defined process include:
* Faster incident resolution
* Reduced costs or revenue losses for the organization resulting from incidents
* Better communication—both internal and external—during incidents
* Continuous learning and improvement

----

### The incident management process

The key to incident management is having a good process and sticking to it. Even that can seem daunting, but the good news is that you can learn from thousands of other IT service teams' experiences. 

One of the top mistakes of busy, growing IT organizations is to try to reinvent the wheel and create processes from scratch. Draw on best practices and don't waste time building a homegrown tool for fielding tickets.

Here is a high-level overview of the important steps for an incident management practice:

----

### Identify an incident and log it

An incident can come from anywhere. An employee can call you to report it, or it can literally fall through the ceiling tile and land in your lap, in the case of an ill-placed network hub and a leaky roof. (Not that we’re speaking from experience...) 

No matter the source, the first two steps are simple: someone identifies an incident, then someone logs it. 

If you receive the incident already logged via your service desk, these first two steps are already done for you. If you get a phone call or the incident is reported via email or text or courier pigeon, it’s the service desk team’s job to properly log it in your service desk. 

These incident logs (i.e., tickets) typically include:

    The name of the person reporting the incident
    The date and time the incident is reported
    A description of the incident (what is down or not working properly)
    A unique identification number assigned to the incident, for tracking

----

### Categorize your incident

Assign a logical, intuitive category (and subcategory, as needed) to every incident. If you don’t, you’re cutting off your ability to later analyze your data and look for trends and patterns, which is a critical part of effective problem management and preventing future incidents. And make sure to choose an ITSM service desk solution that allows you to easily customize incident categories.

----

### Prioritize your incident

Every incident must be prioritized. Start by assessing its impact on the business. Consider the number of people that will be impacted and the potential financial, security, and compliance implications. This will help you determine how much pain the incident is causing and how urgently the business must resolve it.

The best practice here is to define your severity and priority levels before an incident happens, making it simpler for incident managers to gauge priority quickly.

When you’re in doubt about priority level, go with the higher one. It’s better to err on the side of caution than to let something severe fall through the cracks.

Once you’ve set those priorities, address all open incidents in order of priority. Most organizations set clear service agreements around each level of priority, so customers know how quickly to expect a response and resolution.

----

### Respond

Incident response is a pretty broad term, so let’s break it down a bit further into the most likely steps you'll perform once you’ve identified, categorized, and prioritized an incident.

----

### Initial diagnosis

Think of this as the triage function that a hospital performs on new patients. The service desk employee is formulating a quick hypothesis around what is likely wrong, so they can either set about fixing it or follow the appropriate procedures and compile the right resources to get it resolved. Knowledge bases and diagnostic manuals are helpful tools at this step.

If the first agent to respond is able to resolve the incident based on their initial diagnoses and available knowledge and tools, the incident is resolved. Otherwise, it’s time to escalate.

----

### Incident escalation

Your front-line support team should be able to resolve a large number of the most frequent incidents without escalating. But for those they can’t, the goal is to gather and log the right information to help support get up to speed quickly, so they can resolve the incident promptly.

----

### Investigation and diagnosis

ITIL calls this out as its own single step. In reality, it happens throughout the incident lifecycle. 

The first support person to respond is already investigating, to an extent, when he or she collects information, and may even successfully diagnose and even resolve the incident without any escalation required. In that case, you’ve skipped directly through the next few steps: resolution and recovery and incident closure. 

Otherwise, investigation and diagnosis will happen at every step of the way as you escalate or bring in outside resources to consult and assist with the resolution.

----

### Resolution and recovery

Eventually–and, ideally, within your established service level agreements (SLAs)–you will arrive at a diagnosis and perform the necessary steps to resolve the incident. Recovery simply implies the amount of time it may take for operations to be fully restored, since some fixes (like bug patches, etc.) may require testing and deployment even after the proper resolution has been identified.

----

### Incident closure

The incident is then passed back to the service desk (if it was escalated) to be closed. To maintain quality and ensure a smooth process, only service desk employees are allowed to close incidents, and the incident owner should check with the person who reported the incident to confirm that the resolution is satisfactory and the incident can, in fact, be closed.

----

### What is problem management?

Problem management is the process of identifying and managing the causes of incidents on an IT service. It is a core component of ITSM frameworks.

The closer you get to real incident experts, the less you actually hear the question: “What caused the incident?”  Sure, you’ll hear it plenty from executives, and customers, and the press. But the experts know better.

Because the answer to “what caused the incident” is often dry and non-helpful: a rewritten config file, a corrupted database entry.

But what were the contributing causes behind the thing that caused the incident? What were the factors that led up to the incident? How is it possible that a config file could be rewritten? What conditions create a corrupted database entry? These are the questions you hear experts ask. And they’re at the heart of problem management.

Problem management isn’t just about finding and fixing incidents, but identifying and understanding the underlying causes of an incident as well as identifying the best method to eliminate that root cause. Moreover, pinpointing the cause has no value to an organization if it’s a cut-off process completed by a siloed team, so problem management should be constant and widely practiced across multiple teams, including IT, security, and software developers. An incident may be over once the service is up and running again, but until the underlying causes and contributing factors are addressed, the problem remains.

----

### The relationship between problem management and other key ITIL processes

Problem management works alongside incident management and other ITIL practices to form an overall ITSM strategy.

----

### Problem management vs. incident management

ITIL defines a problem as a cause, or potential cause, of one or more incidents. The behaviors behind effective incident management and effective problem management are often similar and overlapping, but there are still key differences. For example, rolling back a recently deploy may get the service operating again and end the incident, but the underlying problem remains.

That said, we believe that problem management and incident management practices are becoming increasingly intertwined. During the times between incidents, IT teams can focus their efforts on problem investigations that lead to improvements and better service quality. This is how problem management becomes the most valuable to the organization.

----

### Problem management and change management

Change management is the process of planning, tracking, and releasing changes without service disruption or downtime. 

When a change does cause disruption or downtime, that change is analyzed during incident and problem management processes.
Problem management and knowledge management

Knowledge management creates a repository of solutions and documentation for common procedures and even incident workarounds. When used together, a healthy knowledge management practice can enable faster incident resolution and fewer incidents altogether.

----

### Problem management and service request management

Service request management is the practice of processing a request from a user for something to be provided, such as access to applications, software enhancements, and information. It can sometimes be difficult to distinguish a service request from an incident. In fact, the two were not distinguished and both lumped into the category “incidents” until the release of ITIL V3 in 2007. ITIL now defines an incident as ‘an unplanned interruption to an IT service or reduction in the quality of an IT service.’ It defines a service request as “a formal request from a user for something to be provided – for example, a request for information or advice; to reset a password; or to install a workstation for a new user.”

----

### What are the benefits of problem management?

Done right, problem management unleashes many benefits for the business.

----

### Decrease time to resolution

Teams that unlock the problems behind today’s incident will be better prepared to attack incidents in the future. By codifying best practices around problem analysis, teams will be able to more quickly respond and take action during the next service disruption.

----

### Avoid costly incidents

Avoiding incidents will save time, money, and lots of pain. According to Gartner, many organizations report downtime costing more than $300,000 per hour. For some web-based services, that number can be dramatically higher.

----

### Increase productivity

Stop responding to incidents so frequently and return resources and time to teams who could be shipping new value to customers.

----

### Empower your team to find and learn from underlying causes

When organizations effectively practice problem management, teams continually investigate, learn from incidents, and ship valuable updates. Unfortunately, many enterprises create a siloed problem management team that is too far removed from day-to-day operations to eliminate the most pressing problems.

----

### Promote continuous service improvement 

Problem management prevents incidents and also delivers value. For instance, fixing an incident causing low level performance also ships valuable service quality improvements.

### Increase customer satisfaction

Better problem management leads to fewer incidents, and happier customers. Alternatively, customer patience wears thin when they notice the same incident happening multiple times. Decreasing the occurrence of repeat incidents builds customer trust.

### The problem management process

When problem management is a heavy, siloed, and separate process, companies can end up creating a dumping ground of problems. This backlog is where problem issues go to die in some teams. It’s best to get problems in front of the teams that can handle and do valuable investigations.

That all being said, it’s good to understand the main steps that contribute to a problem management process. Such as:
* Problem detection - Proactively find problems so they can be fixed, or identify workarounds before future incidents happen.
* Categorization and prioritization - Track and assess known problems to keep teams organized and working on the most relevant and high-value problems.
* Investigation and diagnosis - Identify the underlying contributing causes of the problem and the best course of action for remediation.
* Create a known error record - In ITIL, a known error is “a problem that has a documented root cause and a workaround.” Recording this information leads to less downtime if the problem triggers an incident. This is typically stored in a document called a known error database.
* Create a workaround, if necessary - A workaround is a temporary solution for reducing the impact of problems and keeping them from becoming incidents. These aren’t ideal, but they can limit business impact and avoid a customer-facing incident if the problem can’t be easily identified and eliminated.
* Resolve and close the problem - A closed problem is one that has been eliminated and can no longer cause another incident.

### Problem management best practices and tips

Like we mentioned earlier, the most effective problem management teams we’ve seen blend problem management and incident management.

Setting problem management as a separate practice creates a challenge where the problem team becomes a bottleneck or focuses on the wrong things, like problems from external vendors that they have no control over. Root causes are often not investigated until long after the incident has happened. 

In many cases, your team may benefit from integrating incident management and problem management practices. This is a proactive approach that allows you to understand what led to the incident at the same time you work to resolve it. For example, resolving an incident in software requires identifying poor code (the cause), and then developing replacement code to avoid further incidents (the fix).

Weaving problem and incident together means when teams aren’t in response mode they can look to problems that are most impacting service and performance quality and get ahead, to prevent future incidents.

### Avoid relying on reactive, root-cause analysis

There is rarely just one root cause behind an incident or problem. The best teams holistically consider all potential contributing factors and practice blameless analysis.

----

### Encourage an open environment where problems are shared

Problem and incident analysis should be an open conversation where team members are encouraged to share the facts without fear of punishment or retribution.

----

### Focus on critical services

Prioritize addressing the problems affecting the services that deliver the most value to the organization.

----

### Ask questions and use the ‘5 whys’

Many teams find success using the “5 Whys” technique Taiichi Ohno, the architect of the Toyota Production System.

----

### Spread the knowledge

Open teams share knowledge and insights that their colleagues and adjacent teams can learn from.

----

### Become a learning organization

Effective problem management isn’t something with an end date. Even the best-performing organizations have incidents. The truly world class teams are the ones who constantly iterate on their process, improve it, and lessen the impact of problems on their colleagues and customers.

### Track follow-up

It’s important to develop a clear and standardized way to stay on top of follow-up actions. Since you should always be practicing problem management, it’s important to use ITSM software that will enable your team to prioritize tasks, track progress, and help associate incident issues with problems.
